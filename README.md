- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Bhargav Akula, I am currently pursuing a major in chemical engineering and minoring in computer science.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a researcher, specifically focusing in the area of energy storage systems.
- This github profile contains some random repositories that I have created while learning to program, but I would like to use it to showcase my data science and other research project.

bhargavakula01/bhargavakula01 is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
